/* Description about my project and skills I learned */

/* Color scheme with visual examples */


The purpose of this project is to learn how to create a web page using HTML and CSS. While going through this course I was taught a multitude of beginner friendly ways to set up a simple website using VSCode. The process for me was not an easy one. It challenged my learning in a way I cannot describe but I am grateful for. Along the way I learned many things like headers, footer, link rel, nav class, div, paragraphs, unordered list and more. In each section I was shown the proper way to build something amazing. 

/* The skills I learned in each section */

I learned how to create a HTML in VSCode. The basic set up starting with !DOCTYPE and when typed emmet abbreviation pops up helping you by not having to write the entire code. Also how to 

Bob was already created so I had the simple task of resizing Bob and saving him to my computer and uploading him to my imgs file to be used later.

Designed my hero iamge to be a replica of me gave her some pizzazz. Added my name and where I'm from  along with a border color and radius. Initially the colors I choose was very bright but I eventually changed it to something more fitting. 

Wrote a bio about myself and what I want in life. It's a reflection of the goals I set for myself while navigating this challenging world. How I strive to be better not just for me but for my son and his future.

For my hoobiies I just listed some of the many thing I lie to added some emojis and align-center them to the middle of the page so that it look more uniformed. gave it text-shadow for added affect.

Added pictures to my photo gallery about food using the img src and alt code. Gave it a figcaption title to be displayed on the webpage. I linked it by clicking imgs after i typed it found the pictures I needed and clicked it. I gave each picture some style by resizing them and adding a shadow-box with color. Played around with fonts, size till I got the look I wanted.

I set up GitHub to commit, push and pull to log updates. Link Netlify account to GitHub so I can deploy the new update on a live network.

Picked a color scheme on adobe.com and fonts to add some style. I first choose hot pink and purple with white font and black borders. But I recently changed the colors to be simpler and reader accessible. /* ADD SAMPLE COLORS OF BOTH */

Create a CSS and image file which included the styles and format for each section. For each section I played around with fonts, colors, text-align, margin, padding, background color, border, emojis and many more. I had to figure out how not to cancel out prior codes while not compromising the look I’m trying to achieve. Added new sections for each part of the web page as well as id’s that names each one.

Incorporated litipsum text into the blog section and created columns that was responsive when resized. For the blog we forst started out using Litlpsum story of our own choosing. Then styled the text and font and created a responsive columns so that in mobile mode the text readjust to the size of the device. Later I picked a topic about CSS Animation to replace my Dracula story. I added an example for CSS Animation through codepen.io and embedded it into my page.

Struggled with responsive design lol. This one was particularly frustrating trying to figure out how to get each block the correct color and text. There was a lot of trial and error and I believe I have a better concept now then I did while learning. 

I used a website to create my own logo because the site provided was very confusing to me. When I downloaded the logo it saved everything to a zip file where I would transfer what I need to my imgs file in my about me folder. I also used my logo as my favicon.

Created and embedded my very first YouTube video. For midterm I created another website based on my adventure to the aquarium and made a short video explaining the steps I took making the page had to fast forward because my video was too short which ended up making my voice sound funny which I thought was cool. I then embedded the video into my index.html.

Added a contact form. Learned form id, option value, legends, fieldset format and how to its supposed to be coded. How to create an input type as well as the submit button 

Created a nav bar was simple and easy with help of course. I learned how to created take bullets away from an unordered list, link each section of my page to the navbar, change the direction, padding and margin on the text. I also learned by a lot of YouTube videos about creating a responsive or animated navbar. Though it is still easy it's quite stressful when you're a beginner. With all the different ways it can be a tad bit overwhelming. For example nav links, stylings, containers andsing icons for the hamburger menu, proper placements. It's just so many steps to go through and missing one can throw the whole project out of whack.

The footer was probably the easiest part to do. All it took was a little bit of style and some text to aquire the look i was going for. 

I would like to reserve copyrights to my page. I feel it's not at the level I would be proud enough to release my content.
