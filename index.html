                <p>I want to be able to provide my son with the necessary tools to be happy and succesful in life. 
                It's important to me that he has access to all that life has to offer.</p>

                <p>My goals are to become a Computer Programmer with additional knowledge in other areas of tech. 
                Such fields are App Development, Front End and Back End Development, and maybe even Software Developer.
                I'm interested in creating endless streams of revenue to one day start my own buisness.
                My dreams are big and one day I hope to accomplish everything I set my mind to.</p>

                <p> Some of my favorite hobbies are reading, gaming, going to the beach, hanging out with friends, listening to music and dance. 
                But most importantly being able to relax and enjoy life to the fullest extent possible with the people who mean the most to me. </p>
