        <h2>Biography &#128214;</h2>

            <div>

                <p>I want to be able to provide my son with the necessary tools to be happy and succesful in life. 
                It's important to me that he has access to all that life has to offer.</p>

                <p>My goals are to become a Computer Programmer with additional knowledge in other areas of tech. 
                Such fields are App Development, Front End and Back End Development, and maybe even Software Developer.
                I'm interested in creating endless streams of revenue to one day start my own buisness.
                My dreams are big and one day I hope to accomplish everything I set my mind to.</p>

                <p> Some of my favorite hobbies are reading, gaming, going to the beach, hanging out with friends, listening to music and dance. 
                But most importantly being able to relax and enjoy life to the fullest extent possible with the people who mean the most to me. </p>

            <h2>Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p> 
                    <span>"L</span>ucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me. 
                    It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, 
                    and with the eyes of a very happy wife, 
                    whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, 
                    your life may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain, 
                    for that can never be; but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am now. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. 
                    I must stop, for Jonathan is waking--I must attend to my husband! "Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home with your husband. 
                    I wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, 
                    am full of life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night. 
                    Arthur says I am getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; 
                    and I love him more than ever. He tells me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense. 
                    There he is, calling to me. So no more just at present from your loving</p>

                <p>20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion. 
                    For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: 
                    "Now I can wait; now I can wait." The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, 
                    but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might almost say, "cringing"--softness. I was satisfied with his present condition,
                     and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, 
                     for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:--</p>
                
                <p>"They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The fools!"</p>
                
                <p>It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought. 
                    Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being 
                    is needful to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will only say: "I don't 
                    take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now, and I can wait; I can wait."</p>
